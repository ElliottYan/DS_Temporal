The repository for NAACL 2019 paper "Relation Extraction with Temporal Reasoning Based on Memory Augmented Distant Supervision".

1. TempMEM used to be called MemCNN. Most of the experiment is done by mem_cnn and mem_pcnn. 

Usage: examples for running experiments can be found in scripts. Due to my experience,  

Best results come from the wiki_temp_mem_pe_epoch_70_query_all scripts.
